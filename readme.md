Going from top to bottom, the sections are:

- **Orange**: a header. There would be a large image at this very top with some overlapping introductory text: *Criminal Minds* and some links. A `<header>` element with a `<img>`, `<h1>` and `<nav>` within.
- **Purple**: the first section which is covered by an introduction of *Criminal Minds*. The first `<section>` within our `<main>` element.
- **Green**: the second section which holds breif and images of 9 main characters. I plan to have three images in one line with their introductory text (name and job) below. This would be another `<section>` within `<main>`.
- **Blue**: the third section with more words. This is a section for seasons, a list of seasons with links would be shown here. The thrid `<section>` within `<main>`.
- **Chartreuse**: the fourth section, with a list of top 10 episodes. This would be the fourth `<section>` within the `<main>` tag.
- **Bluish-green**: the final section. A form to add a comment, including a topic and content. This would be the fifth, and final `<section>` within the `<main>` tag.
- **Yellow**: a footer. This is a section with extra links, like for contact details. All content would be wrapped in a `<footer>`.
